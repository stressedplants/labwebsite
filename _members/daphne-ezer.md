My lab focusses on how plants integrate environmental signals across different temporal scales.  Previously, I was a Turing Fellow at the Alan Turing Institute, the UK Institue for Data Science and AI and the University of Warwick Department of Statistics.  Before that, I was a postdoctoral researcher in Dr. Phil Wigge's lab group at the Sainsbury Laboratory in the University of Cambridge, which I owe as my introduction into plant biology and temperature sensing.  I did my PhD in Genetics at the University of Cambridge Systems Biology under Dr. Boris Adryan, as a Marshall Scholar.  My undergraduate degree was in Computer Science and Biology at Duke University, doing my undergraduate thesis research in the lab of Dr. Alex Hartemink.
