Gina is a human. She is fascinated by how living organisms (plants in particular) process information and produce outputs. Her PhD project explores how plants integrate signals from multiple environmental stimuli. Specifically, she is using wet lab and computational approaches to  investigate how morning light signals affect disease resistance in Arabidopsis and lettuce. She hopes this research can be used to increase crop production.

Outside the lab, Gina is a musician who plays too many instruments. She also dabbles with visual arts.
