Kayla is interested in the complexities of how different environmental conditions interact with each other.  She helps manage the lab and make sure that everything runs as smoothly as possible, while also conducting her own research about the role of planting density on temperature response.  

She enjoys baking, knitting and building self-contained ecosystems.
