Sarah investigates the genetic basis for how plants respond to changes in photoperiod to detect the changes in the seasons.  She hypothesises that plants that respond quickly to changes in photoperiod will have more synchronous development, a trait that is important to farmers.  Sarah has a background in mathematics and is developing new tools in Functional Data Analysis (FDA) to find quantitative trait loci associated with features that change over time.

She is also planning to travel around the world.
