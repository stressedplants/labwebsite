# Our wild lighting system

Our lab is interested in how plants sense subtle changes in light frequencies in the morning. [Gina Vong](https://stressedplants.github.io/labwebsite/members/gina-vong.html) is developing code to programme our 9 channel Heliospectra Dyna lights to mimic real sunrises, while [Will Claydon](https://stressedplants.github.io/labwebsite/members/will-claydon.html) and [Ethan Redmond](https://stressedplants.github.io/labwebsite/members/ethan-redmond.html) have been programming the lights in our Nightshade, a box we have that is equipped with a very sensitive camera that can be used for bioluminescence experiments.  

Both camps have produced competing music videos: which do you prefer?
