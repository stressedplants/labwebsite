The entire Ezer lab journeyed together to Durham to attend the Genetic's Society Seed Plant Research Meeting.  Gina and Will presented posters, while Ethan presented a talk.  Sarah won a Â£50 gift certificate and a chocolate egg from the prize draw.  We all had fun going to the conference dinner at Durham Castle.  It was especially nice to hear lots of talks about Arabidopsis researchers and to see how our research fits into the wider context.  I was especially proud of the great questions that the lab members asked the speakers.
