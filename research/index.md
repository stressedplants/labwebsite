# <i class="fas fa-microscope"></i>Research

The main biological focus of the group is around environmental signal integration in plants, including model plants, crop species, and ecologically-important species. We are interested in how plants integrate environmental signals over time, across different time scales (minute-by-minute, hourly, daily, seasonally) to make developmental decisions.  We are also interested in stochastic variability in developmental phenotypes and how this impacts fitness.  

For instance, some of our current projects address research questions such as: How do plants sense and respond to the colours of a sunrise?  How do plants integrate light and temperature signals in the early morning to entrain the circadian clock?  How to plants adapt to changes in day length across the seasons?  What controls stochasticity in flowering times?
